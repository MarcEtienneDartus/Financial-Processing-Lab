# Financial-Processing-Lab üöÄ

## Introduction üìö
> This repo is the lab part of [Financial-Processing](https://github.com/MarcEtienneDartus/Financial-Processing) üìñ.

This course aims to complement traditional signal processing courses. It covers the entire introduction to signal processing, from defining a signal, to intermediate concepts, such as filtering.

The aim of this course, as a complement, is not to dig deep in the theoretical and "boring" part of the different concepts. Rather, it aims to give meaning and illustrations to the concepts of signal processing.

To better illustrate the concepts of signal processing, what's better than applications ?!

Theses applications simply allow you to exercise signal processing on financial data. It goes from the very basics analysis to more complex ones.
It's about showing how this powerful tool can get information out of a signal.

To do this, most of the applications are based on real financial data.

The statements will guide you on the use of Python and its signal processing libraries. Python is a very affordable, very powerful language, increasingly present in many engineering fields (Big data, finance, IoT, etc.).

In order to be able to work without worrying about installing anything, the statements will also guide you on the use of [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/), which is a python development environment already counting a lot of libraries useful for signal processing.

## Roadmap üìù

To do these applications you will find all the informations on the [financial processing website](https://financial-processing.onrender.com/).
